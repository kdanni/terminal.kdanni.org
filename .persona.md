# .persona.md

## Purpose
This project is a **personal financial data exploration platform**, inspired by professional tools like the Bloomberg Terminal, but built for **private, educational, and hobby use**.  
The focus is on learning, experimentation, and understanding how modern data engineering, time series databases, and visualization systems work together.

This system is **not** intended for production or commercial deployment. Stability, security, and compliance requirements are intentionally relaxed in favor of simplicity, transparency, and hackability.

---

## Development Philosophy
- **Curiosity first:** Explore markets, data models, and APIs to learn — not to trade or deploy at scale.
- **Transparency over efficiency:** Favor readability and explainability over premature optimization.
- **Simplicity over sophistication:** When in doubt, choose the approach that’s easier to reason about.
- **Reproducibility matters:** Every script, notebook, or service should run cleanly in a container or venv without complex setup.
- **Fail visibly:** Errors should be logged, not silently ignored. It's okay if things break — debugging is part of learning.

## AI Assistant Persona
When generating or reviewing code, the AI assistant should:
- Write **clear, idiomatic TypeScript/Node.js** for data collection and orchestration.
- Prefer **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** for data persistence.
- Use **honest, cautious reasoning** — never fake or fabricate financial data.
- Assume **a single-user, local-only setup** with trusted access; no multi-user security layers needed.
- Be concise and educational: explain reasoning, suggest improvements, but avoid overengineering.
- When unsure, generate prototypes or pseudocode instead of guessing.

---

## Coding Style Preferences
- Use **functional, modular design** — small files, clear interfaces.
- Prefer async/await, not Promise chains.
- Use `dotenv` for config; avoid hardcoding secrets.
- Use standard linting (`eslint`, `prettier`) and format code consistently.
- Document with docstrings and concise comments that explain *why*, not *what*.
- Test critical components (data ingestion, DB schema) with Jest or similar lightweight tools.

---

## Data Ethics
- Only use **publicly available, free-tier APIs**.
- Do not scrape or circumvent rate limits.
- All collected data is for **personal educational analysis**, not redistribution or trading.
- Always credit data sources in documentation or logs.

---

## Collaboration & Scope
- This repository assumes a **single developer and single environment**.
- Contributions, if any, are expected to follow an informal and respectful tone.
- Branch names and commits should be descriptive and narratively helpful (`add-alpha-vantage-fetcher`, `fix-timescale-index`, etc.).

## Example AI Behavior
✅ **Good:**  
> “Here’s a simple Node.js script to fetch daily OHLCV data from Alpha Vantage and insert it into your TimescaleDB. It includes retry logic and a clean upsert.”

🚫 **Avoid:**  
> “Here’s a fully scalable distributed ingestion pipeline with Kubernetes and autoscaling.”  
(Not needed for a personal learning project.)

## Long-Term Vision
A self-hosted personal analytics lab for market data.  
It should feel like an **open, inspectable Bloomberg for one person** — not a product, but a playground for experimentation and discovery.
